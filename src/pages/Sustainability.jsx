        <h2 style={{marginTop:16}}>Our commitment to sustainable aviation</h2>
        <p>
          At Innosim Design AB, we are committed to ongoing environmental improvement through responsible, sustainable practices. We comply with relevant environmental laws and operate with efficient, structured processes.
        </p>

        <h3 style={{marginTop:16}}>Greener technologies (substitution principle)</h3>
        <p>
          We replace outdated technologies with greener alternatives and assess environmental impact when risks are involved. Our approach follows the waste hierarchy—prioritising prevention, reuse, recycling, and other recovery.
        </p>

        <h3 style={{marginTop:12}}>Culture of responsibility</h3>
        <p>
          Managers ensure employees are informed and empowered to follow our environmental policy. We foster a culture where everyone takes part in sustainable decision‑making.
        </p>

        <h3 style={{marginTop:12}}>Continuous improvement</h3>
        <p>
          Environmental activities are documented and regularly reviewed. Clear guidelines and routines help staff make environmentally responsible choices in daily operations.
        </p>

        <h3 style={{marginTop:12}}>Competence and awareness</h3>
        <p>
          Our team maintains strong environmental knowledge and continually develops skills relevant to our impact.
        </p>

        <h3 style={{marginTop:12}}>Minimising climate impact</h3>
        <p>
          We tailor services to reduce environmental harm, optimise transportation, avoid hazardous chemicals where possible, and prioritise energy‑efficient technologies. Facilities are designed for resource efficiency, and we favour digital meetings over travel when practical.
