        <p className="lead">Our commitment to sustainable aviation guides day-to-day operations and long-term decisions. We treat sustainability as an ongoing, proactive process.</p>

        <h2 style={{marginTop:16}}>Our commitment to sustainable aviation</h2>
        <p>
          We comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and structure our work to be systematic, efficient, and continuously improving.
        </p>

        <h3 style={{marginTop:16}}>Substitution principle</h3>
        <p>
          We replace older technologies with safer, more environmentally friendly alternatives wherever possible. Decisions that involve significant risk include an assessment of potential environmental effects, and we act to prevent or mitigate them. Our approach follows the waste hierarchy: prevention, reuse, recycling, and other recovery.
        </p>

        <h3 style={{marginTop:12}}>Personal responsibility</h3>
        <p>
          Managers ensure employees are informed about our environmental policy and equipped to follow it. We build a culture where everyone contributes to sustainable operations.
        </p>

        <h3 style={{marginTop:12}}>Continuous environmental efforts</h3>
        <p>
          We document and follow up on environmental activities. Clear rules, guidelines, and routines help all employees make environmentally sound choices.
        </p>

        <h3 style={{marginTop:12}}>Competence</h3>
        <p>
          Our staff maintains relevant environmental and systems knowledge, and continuously develops competencies that influence our environmental impact.
        </p>

        <h3 style={{marginTop:12}}>Resource adaptation and climate impact</h3>
        <p>
          Services are adapted to minimize environmental impact. We favor low-impact transport and apply energy-efficient technologies where possible. Consumption, transportation, and waste handling follow the waste hierarchy; hazardous chemicals are avoided where feasible, aligned with the substitution principle. When appropriate, electronic meetings replace physical travel.
